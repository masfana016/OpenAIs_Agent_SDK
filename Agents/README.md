# Agents

### What Are Agents?

Agents are the backbone of our application, acting like intelligent assistants that bring your ideas to life. Powered by large language models (LLMs), agents can be tailored to handle tasks like answering questions, generating creative content, or automating workflows. Each agent is an LLM customized with three key ingredients:

- **Instructions**: A prompt that defines the agent’s role, like "Be a cheerful customer support helper."
- **Model**: The LLM behind the agent, with settings to fine-tune its style and tone.
- **Tools**: Add-ons, such as web search or database access, that empower the agent to do more.

### Configuring Your Agent

Setting up an agent is straightforward. You’ll define these core components:

1. **Instructions (System Prompt)**:
   - This is the agent’s mission statement, guiding how it behaves.
   - Example: "You’re a friendly tutor who explains coding in plain English."
   - Think of it as giving the agent its personality and purpose.

2. **Model**:
   - Choose the LLM that powers your agent (e.g., Grok 3 or another model).
   - Optional settings let you tweak its behavior:
     - **Temperature**: Controls creativity (0 for precise, 1 for imaginative).
     - **Top_p**: Adjusts response consistency (lower values for predictability).
   - Example: Set `temperature=0.5` for clear, focused responses.

3. **Tools**:
   - Equip your agent with tools to tackle specific tasks.
   - Examples:
     - A calculator for crunching numbers.
     - A web search tool for real-time insights.
     - A database connection to retrieve user data.
   - Tools make your agent more than just a chatbot—they let it interact with the world.

### A Real-World Example

Imagine you’re building a customer support agent:
- **Instructions**: "You’re a polite assistant helping users with order inquiries."
- **Model**: Use a fast LLM with `temperature=0.5` for concise, clear answers.
- **Tools**: Add a tool to check order statuses in a database.

When a user asks, "Where’s my package?", the agent:
1. Follows its instructions to respond courteously.
2. Crafts a clear answer using the LLM.
3. Queries the database to provide the exact order status.

### Why Agents Matter

Agents are what make our app shine. They’re flexible, powerful, and endlessly customizable. Whether you need a FAQ bot, a content creator, or an automation wizard, you can craft the perfect agent by tweaking its instructions, model, and tools.
